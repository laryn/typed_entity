## INTRODUCTION

Typed Entity provides a simple way to treat you existing entities like typed
objects. This will allow you to have a more maintainable and easier to debug
codebase.

  [project page](https://www.drupal.org/project/typed_entity).

* Submit bug reports and feature suggestions, or track changes in the
  [issue queue](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/typed_entity).

* An example module is also provided. You can find it in the
  `modules/typed_entity_example` directory.

## REQUIREMENTS

This module requires no modules outside of Drupal core.

## INSTALLATION

* Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. For further
  information, see

* Optionally, install the Typed Entity UI submodule to explore typed
  repositories definitions.

## CONFIGURATION

way.
